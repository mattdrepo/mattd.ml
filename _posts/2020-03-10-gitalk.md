If you're going to use this theme, note a few parameters of gitalk in `_config.yml`.

1. `id` : The default is `location.pathname`, the theme changed the id to `simple` in order to unify comments, if you want to use this theme please change back to the default value.
2. `title` (optional) : I set it to `simple` in order to unify the comments.
3. `body` (optional) : You can delete it.
